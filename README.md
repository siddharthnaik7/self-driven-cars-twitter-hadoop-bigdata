# SELF-DRIVING CARS: TWITTER REVIEWS COMPARISON
## Summary
The aim of this project is to compare top self driving car companies on twitter reviews. I chose Audi, Mercedes, Nissan, Tesla, Toyota and Volvo for our comparision. After scraping the data from twitter I performed various sentiment analysis task to get the meaningful insights. All the mapreduce task was performed using Java and the scraping part was done in python.
## Steps Followed:
Data Scraping, Data Cleaning, Data Exploration and 4 different Mapreduce task performing sentiment analysis.
## Data Source:
https://twitter.com/
## Mapreduce Task:
Task1 - Find the positive and negative number of tweets for each brand of self-driving car?
Task2 - Find the number of likes tweet got for each brand of self-driving car?
Task3 - Find the number of likes for positive and negative tweet of each brand?
Task4 - Find the positive and negative number of tweet received for overall self-driving cars?
## Conclusion:
I was able to conclude that Tesla, Audi and Mercedes were most disscused self-driving brands on twitter. While mercedes had the most number of likes on their tweets, Tesla had farily more postive feedback than the rest. Also, I compared tweets of these top 6 brands with all the self driving car tweets on twitter and found more negative feedback on the self-driving car concept. This shows that many still dont trust this concept.
